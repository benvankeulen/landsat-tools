about=Tool to decode bit-packed quality assurance (QA) information from Landsat Level-1 (*BQA.TIF) and Landsat Higher Level (*pixel_qa; *radsat_qa; *sr_cloud_qa; *sr_aerosol) bands. Unlike bit-unpacking tools, this tool does not generate new bands, but instead builds an attribute table from the input and populates each unique value with its respective classification.
