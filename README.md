Repository for scripts I use to pre-process, characterize, and evaluate data 
products. 

Many products, such as Landsat Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Reflectance, Surface
Reflectance (SR) and SR-derived spectral indices are available at no cost from
the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center Science Processing
Architecture (ESPA; https://espa.cr.usgs.gov).
